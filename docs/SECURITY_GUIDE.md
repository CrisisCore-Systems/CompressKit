# CompressKit Security Guide

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the CompressKit application to protect against common vulnerabilities and ensure secure operation in various environments.

## Security Architecture

CompressKit implements a layered security approach:

1. **Security Module**: A consolidated security module (`security_module.sh`) provides core security functions
2. **Input Validation**: Dedicated validation functions for all user inputs
3. **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling with security-specific responses
4. **File Operations**: Secure file operations with permission controls
5. **Command Execution**: Restricted command execution with allowlists

## Security Features

### 1. Path Security (`safe_path`)

CompressKit implements multiple layers of path security to prevent path traversal attacks:

- **Path Traversal Prevention**: All file paths are validated to prevent directory traversal attacks
- **Null Byte Prevention**: All paths are sanitized to remove null bytes
- **URL Encoding Detection**: Paths are checked for URL-encoded traversal attempts
- **Symbolic Link Protection**: Explicit checks prevent symbolic links from accessing sensitive directories
- **Sensitive Path Protection**: Access to sensitive system files is restricted based on security level

Example usage:

```bash
# Always validate file paths before use
safe_path="/tmp/user_files"
if ! safe_file_path=$(safe_path "$user_input"); then
    log_error "Invalid file path provided"
    return 1
fi
```

### 2. Command Execution Security (`safe_execute`)

CompressKit implements strict controls on command execution:

- **Allowlist-based Execution**: Only explicitly allowed commands can be executed
- **Argument Validation**: Command arguments are properly processed
- **No Use of `eval`**: Dangerous constructs like `eval` are never used

Example usage:

```bash
# Never use direct commands with user input
safe_execute "grep 'pattern' '$safe_file_path'"
```

### 3. File Operation Security

All file operations follow secure practices:

- **Atomic File Operations**: Critical file updates use atomic operations
- **Secure Temporary Files**: Temporary files are created with secure permissions
- **Permission Controls**: All files are created with appropriate permissions

Example usage:

```bash
# Use secure_tempfile for all temporary file needs
temp_file=$(secure_tempfile "prefix")
```

### 4. Input Validation

CompressKit implements comprehensive input validation:

- **Type Validation**: Input types are validated
- **Range Validation**: Numeric inputs are validated within ranges
- **Allowlist Validation**: Inputs are validated against allowed values

Example usage:

```bash
# Always validate user input against allowed values
validate_input "$user_quality" "high" "medium" "low"
```

### 5. Security Incident Reporting

Security incidents are reported and logged:

- **Incident Logs**: Detailed security incidents are logged
- **Admin Notification**: Administrators are notified of security incidents
- **Audit Trail**: All security events are recorded

## Security Best Practices for Developers

When working on CompressKit:

1. **Use Security Module Functions**: Always use the provided security functions
2. **Validate All Input**: Never trust user input without validation
3. **Check Return Codes**: Always check return codes from security functions
4. **Use Consistent Error Handling**: Follow the error handling pattern
5. **Write Security Tests**: All security functions must have corresponding tests

## Security Response Process

If a security vulnerability is discovered:

1. The security incident is reported and logged
2. The vulnerability is assessed and prioritized
3. A fix is developed and tested
4. The fix is deployed to all supported versions
5. Users are notified of the security update

## Security Updates

CompressKit security updates are released as needed to address vulnerabilities. Users should regularly check for updates.
